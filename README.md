# Hi, I'm Anir ELHADDAJ ðŸ‘‹

You can call me ObjectiveVirtual (I prefer that), I'm a young 14 y/o independent Moroccan developper working from home. I know a bit of python, that's it.

I am working on ZBlock (A hosts file manager designed to block ADs), I'm aiming at learning Rust and C++.

I'm coding projects like these as a hobby, generally when I am on vacation or when I come back from school.
